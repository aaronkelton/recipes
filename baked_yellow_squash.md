# Baked Squash
Yellow squash, including crookneck, baked in the oven. Roasting means to circulate air, so this is NOT roasting.

I first tried directly on the baking "half" sheet, to accommodate three squashes: whole, halved, and 1/4" sliced.

Apply olive oil, salt, and pepper to all surface areas.

Baked at 400 F (200 C) for variable times:
* 20 min sliced
* 25 min halved
* 30 min whole

## Notes
* Don't lube the sheet; oiled squash is sufficient to not stick

### Whole Squash
* Whole can only take outer seasoning unless you inject it; so be liberal with your spice
* As it bakes, the soft shell will flatten and char; consider rotating every 7.5 minutes for even charring
* Baked whole, it will retain the most moisture

### Halved Squash
* Try to bake one face down, the other face up; might be nice to char the flesh than the shell

### Sliced Squash
* The downside to sliced is that you should probably flip each piece halfway through; kinda annoying
