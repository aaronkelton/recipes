# Air Fryer / Roasted / Convection — Wings
_circulating hot air is the key idea here_

1. Oil and season wings (don't forget baking powder to make it crispy)
2. Roast at 375 F for 20 minutes

### Findings
* Largest drum piece was above 180 F

## What to try in the future
### Dehydration techniques
* Traeger between 165 and 225 Super Smoke prior to oil or season, maybe an hour?
* Same as above but just the oven on a rack
